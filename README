Welcome to the README, follow the steps below to compile, run, and test our code.

1.Type "make" into command line when in the project directory.
2.Type "java WebServer" to run the class that was created by the makefile.
3.In a seperate command line type "telnet localhost 8080" in order to test the server.
4.When prompted type "GET hello.txt HTTP/1.1" or "GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1" or HTTP/1.0 and the server will respond to the request.

We used telnet to test our server so we figured we'd add that to the readme so you know exactly how we got ours working.
We also added a sample text file that we were using to test(hello.txt) as well but you can also add your own test file.
